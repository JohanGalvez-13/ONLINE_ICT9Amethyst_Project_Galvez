			<td>Fire protection refers to measures taken to prevent fire from becoming destructive, reduce the impact of an uncontrolled fire, and save lives and property. It is an everyday action. The fire regulations in force must be implemented in factories, living areas, public places and transportation. Education on fire and regular fire drills are also major compliance issues.</td>

			<td style="color: yellow;">If you have a fireplace, it’s important to always watch what you’re doing as well. You want to make sure that you put out the fire well before you’re going to leave the area; that way you can watch the fireplace and make sure that the fire doesn’t pop back up. Embers can continue to smolder and burn and logs can continue to have flames inside of them that show up much later. You want to make sure you completely smother the fire and then watch for anything else that might show up later before you go to bed or leave the house.</td>

			<td style="color: yellow;">Clutter in your home is actually one way that fires can not only start spontaneously but also that they can spread excessively. By keeping less clutter in your home you’ll be able to cut down on your risk and also make it more likely that you can save your home in the event of a fire. Too many things cluttering the area can give the fire plenty of space to spread to so make sure you keep your home a little more organized and getting rid of some of the excess clutter.</td>

			<td style="color: yellow;">Your dryer uses a lot of heat and even your dishwasher uses a decent amount of heat. Space heaters and heated blankets do as well. These are all things that you definitely don’t want to leave running when you’re not home because they could easily catch fire and cause a huge fire that you’re not home to detect. If you’re in the house and awake you can stop the problem before it turns into a huge fire, but if you’re not home or even if you’re asleep that doesn’t happen.</td>

			<td style="color: yellow;">That doesn’t mean you need to dig into the walls in your home to check electrical wires, but you should be checking anything that’s visible. Monitor the wall outlets in your home and pay attention to any that suddenly don’t work. It could be evidence of a problem behind the walls. Look for cords to your electric belongings that are frayed or damaged. These could be signs of problems as well and you don’t want to plug them into your electrical system if you know there’s a problem already.</td>
